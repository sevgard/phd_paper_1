# phd_paper_1
This is the repository for the first paper in my Ph.D. Thesis. 
The pdf-file of the paper is attached as well. 
The code contains the theoretical model of the referrals, which has 2 different versions.
1. The version with imperfect information: takes into account the case when the labor market participants 
do not have full information about general and speicific abilities of the workers, but can only observe their overall productivity

2. The version with perfect information: takes into account the case when the labor market participants
observe both general and firm-specific ability of the workers. 

The repository contains 2 .py files for imperfect information model and 2 .py files for perferct information model.
- File "imperf_info.py" contains the main functions for the imperfect information case.
- File "perf_info.py" contaions the main functions for the perfect information case.
- File "graphs_for_imperf_info.py" contains the code for building graphs that I use to analyze the model with imperfect informaton.
- File "graphs_for_perf_info.py" contains the code for building graphs that I use to analyze the model with perfect information.

The details of the model itself are presented in the PDF-file "phd_paper_1.pdf".
